##### Internal Libraries used: <em>UnitTest, Time</em>

## Project Description
Created a selenium bot that mimic a user's behavior on entering Booking.com, finding a city, choosing depart/return dates, specifiying number of rooms/adults on the trip, applying filters such as 4/5-Star hotels, sorting options like lowest price, and finally displaying (via a table) of the search's page results through the Command Line Interface.

## Program Design
â€¢ Set up was with a basic UNIT-testing Framework provided for Python Selenium on the documentation. As mentioned on the documentation: 

A page object represents an area where the test interacts within the web application user interface. Benefits of using page object pattern:
  * Easy to read test cases
  * Creating reusable code that can share across multiple test cases
  * Reducing the amount of duplicated code
  * If the user interface changes, the fix needs changes in only one place
